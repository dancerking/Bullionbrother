Requires at least: 2.8
Tested up to: 4.5
Stable tag: 1.5.8

== Description ==

Use the MailChimp List Subscribe plugin to quickly add a MailChimp signup form widget to your WordPress 2.8 or higher site. 

After installation, you’ll log in with your API key, select your MailChimp list, choose merge fields and groups, and add the widget to your site.  Typically, installation and setup will take about 5-10 minutes, and absolutely everything can be done via the WordPress Setting GUI, with no file editing at all.

WordPress.com compatibility is limited to Business tier users only. [How to add a signup form if you have a WordPress.com site](https://mailchimp.com/help/ways-to-add-a-signup-form-in-wordpress/).

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get started using it.

= Version 2.8+ =
1. Unzip our archive and upload the entire mailchimp directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/ directory`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to **Settings** click **MailChimp Setup**.
4. Enter your MailChimp API Key and let the plugin verify it.
5. Select the list where you want to send new MailChimp subscribers.
6. Optional: turn **MonkeyRewards** on or off.
7. Optional: Turn **Merge Fields** and **Groups** on or off. Navigate to **Appearance**, and click **Widgets**. Drag the MailChimp Widget into one of your Widget Areas.


= Advanced =
If you have a custom coded sidebar or bells and whistles that prevent enabling widgets  through the WordPress GUI, complete these steps instead.

WordPress v2.8 or higher: 
` [mailchimpsf_form] `

If you are adding it inside a php code block, pop this in:

` mailchimpSF_signup_form(); `

Or, if you are dropping it in between a bunch of HTML, use this:

`<?php mailchimpSF_signup_form(); ?>`

Where ever you want it to show up.

Note: in some environments you will need to install the Exec_PHP plugin to use that method of display. It can be found here: http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/exec-php/

== Upgrading ==

If you are upgrading to version 1.2.1 and you used the widget in your sidebar previously, all you need to do is drag the `MailChimp Widget` back into the sidebar, visit the MailChimp settings page (which will have maintained your prior settings), click the "Update List" button, and you're done!
